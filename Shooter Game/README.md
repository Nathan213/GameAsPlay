As a beginner in Unity, I had a lot of trouble with creating a first-person shooter game. Shooting the gun and creating bullet decals proved to be quite difficult, and it took a lot of time to figure out the right methods to implement these features. Unfortunately, I was unable to fully understand how to operate the enemy AI, despite spending a significant amount of time attempting to do so. Overall, the process of making an FPS game proved to be challenging, but with patience and persistence, I was able to make progress and learn valuable skills in game development.
