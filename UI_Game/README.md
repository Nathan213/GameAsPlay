As a beginner to Unity, creating a UI game proved to be a challenging task. Setting up the environment and adding objects took longer than expected, and I often found myself getting stuck on simple tasks. However, with the help of a template, I was able to create a decent game that met the project's requirements. The template provided me with a foundation to build upon and helped me understand the structure of the code. Through this experience, I learned how to create a game environment, add objects, and create UIs using Unity's UI system. The project taught me valuable skills that I can apply to future game development projects.
