Making a 3D platformer game was an extremely difficult process, with numerous challenges to overcome. One of the main obstacles was character animation. Creating fluid, natural movements for the player character was a really confusing and time-consuming task. Additionally, getting the camera position right was crucial to ensure players had a clear view of the game environment and could navigate it effectively. Finally, designing smooth transitions between different gameplay elements was also challenging. Despite these difficulties, the creation of a 3D platformer game was a highly rewarding experience and I learned a lot of skills I can employ in the final game.
